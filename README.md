# Personal Website of Valentyna Antoniuk

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a minimal personal CV website to present basic information and work experience.  
An additional goal is to explore and better understand how Astro works by using it in a real-world project.

## ⚒️ Instruments

This project uses **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** for its simplicity and performance-first approach, making it ideal for small, static sites like a CV.
**[React](https://reactjs.org/)** is integrated for building dynamic and reusable UI components with ease.
**[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)** offer scoped styling without the overhead of a larger styling solution, keeping the project lightweight and maintainable.

## 🔍 Technical Overview

This project was built with a focus on rapid development and minimal dependencies. The goal was to achieve a fast, lightweight setup that remains easy to learn and expand.

- **Rapid Development**: Using Astro enabled quick prototyping and seamless integration of small interactive React islands.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: The stack consists of only essential packages, providing a low entry barrier and reducing complexity.
- **Static by Default, SSR on Demand**: The project starts as a static site, with server-side rendering (SSR) available when needed. This ensures flexibility and scalability.
- **Deployment**: Automated release on push into the main branch;

## 💡 Project Reflection

**Astro** proved to be an excellent choice for a simple personal website project.

Its intuitive syntax, **React island support**, and effortless SSR setup made it easy to build and maintain.

**Netlify**'s built-in Astro support further simplified the deployment process—automated builds and releases triggered by pushes to `main` have been invaluable for streamlining development. Netlify offers built-in form handling features that streamline the process of capturing and managing user submissions without requiring additional backend infrastructure. This functionality enables seamless configuration of email notifications for the contact form.

> **Overall, the chosen tools proved reliable and efficient, producing outcomes that aligned well with my goals.**
