    "recommendations": "Valentyna is currently serving as a Front-end ReactJS Team Lead, on our primary Financial Services Marketplace. Quite simply, there's no one I'd rather have in that role than Valentyna. Her ability to deconstruct and solve challenging problems, her unwavering commitment to maintaining the highest quality deliverables, and her confident oversight of the team of engineers working with her are as good as, or better, than any engineer I've had the pleasure of working with in my 30 years in this industry.\n \n She is never afraid to speak her mind and stand up for her opinion, but only after careful consideration, making sure she has a firm grasp of the topic at hand, and always with the greatest of tact. Further, her depth of expertise in software engineering goes much further than just React, which combination makes her a critical resource for us in the design and development of our broader software architecture. \n She would be an invaluable addition to any organization.",
